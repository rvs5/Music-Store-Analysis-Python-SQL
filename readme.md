<!-- Analysis of music store  -->

In this Project objective is to:-

Examine the dataset with PostgreSQL and help the music store understand its business frowth by answering questions.

- In this project I have analyzed the music store dataset by writing PostgreSQL queries to answer interesting questions about music and its customers. The dataset contains information about the customer, Invoices, Genre etc. This analysis can be used to find the answers to questions like:

-- Who is the senior most employee based on job title
-- Which country have the most invoices?
-- Which city has best customers?
-- the artist who have written th most rock music in our dataset?
-- Number of purchases made by each country and their top famous genre name?
